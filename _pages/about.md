<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Xiru Hang, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Civil Engineering at Shenzhen University, focusing on the seismic resilience of underground structures.

My research interest includes sustainable structure deveopment and damage assessment. During my Master's studies, I have participated in several research projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China project on the fundamental theories of resilience in deep underground spaces of megacities. Through these experiences, I have accumulated extensive expertise in experimentation and data analysis. Additionally, I have published a paper in Engineering Structures (second author, with my supervisor as the first author), further demonstrating my research and academic writing abilities.

In my Ph.D. studies, I aim to delve deeper into the study of structural resilience and sustainability assessment. I am eagerly looking forward to this next step in my academic journey, as it will provide a solid foundation for my research.

In my future academic career, I aspire to contribute to the field of sustainable development through high-quality research. I also look forward to collaborating with other scholars and researchers to advance scientific progress.
